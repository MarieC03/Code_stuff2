subroutine bc_int(level,qt,ixI^L,ixO^L,w,x)

! internal boundary, user defined
!
! This subroutine can be used to artificially overwrite ALL conservative 
! variables in a user-selected region of the mesh, and thereby act as
! an internal boundary region. It is called just before external (ghost cell)
! boundary regions will be set by the BC selection. Here, you could e.g. 
! want to introduce an extra variable (nwextra, to be distinguished from nwaux)
! which can be used to identify the internal boundary region location.
! Its effect should always be local as it acts on the mesh.
